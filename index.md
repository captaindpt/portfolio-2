# welcome

i make things. paintings, songs, communities, robots, and now, artificial brains.
currently i am:
- trying to finish my degree at uofg<hyperlink> in Systems Engineering and Computing
- doing research and working with my uni's IT dept to explore application with LLMs and other AI technologies
* building Arboros, a community built to provide a space for creatives to share their work and collaborate on projects.
* contributing to open source projects in the AI/ML space

## what I do

i first got interested in computing in 2017 when i was in highschool in sanandaj, iran through a book that explained how you can build universes only out of switches that turn on and off. through the years i tried immerse myself more in this world, getting into the open source ecosystem, learning cybersecurity, helped my family members digitalize their businesses where it applied.

i got very interested in hacker culture and wider tech in general so decided to pursue systems engineering in uofg. concepts of electrical engineering, mechancial engineering i learned through this.

my main interest now is building with and around LLMs. i am very interested in finding out what makes a good LLM application and for myself to become a better engineer and builder


## get in touch

Feel free to explore my work or reach out if you'd like to collaborate on something interesting.

*This site is my digital space to document projects, share learnings, and connect with fellow builders.*
