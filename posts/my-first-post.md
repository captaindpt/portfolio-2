# My First Post

This is my very first post written in **Markdown**!

Markdown makes it easy to format text:

*   List item 1
*   List item 2

FORM characteristic equation: 1+G(s)H(s)=0
ARRANGE into standard form: a₀s^n + a₁s^(n-1) + ... + a_n = 0


CONSTRUCT Routh array
IDENTIFY sign changes in first column
DETERMINE stability or range of K for stability
HANDLE special cases correctly

> This is a blockquote, often used for citations or emphasizing text.

Here is some inline `code`.

```javascript
// And here is a code block
console.log("Hello, Markdown!");
```

It's pretty neat.
