# Building My Portfolio with Eleventy

After considering various frameworks and platforms, I decided to build my portfolio with **Eleventy** (11ty). Here's why this choice made perfect sense for my needs.

## Why Static Sites?

Static site generators offer several compelling advantages:

- **Performance** - Pre-built HTML loads incredibly fast
- **Security** - No database or server-side vulnerabilities  
- **Simplicity** - Easy to deploy and maintain
- **SEO-friendly** - Great for search engine optimization

## Eleventy's Strengths

What sets Eleventy apart from other static site generators:

### 1. Template Flexibility
Eleventy supports multiple templating languages:
- Liquid (what I'm using)
- Nunjucks
- Handlebars
- Markdown with front matter

### 2. Zero Configuration
```javascript
// .eleventy.js - minimal config needed
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  return {
    dir: {
      input: ".",
      output: "_site"
    }
  };
};
```

### 3. Data-Driven Content
Using `_data` files makes content management elegant:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Portfolio",
      "description": "This very site!"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development Experience

The hot reload functionality makes development a breeze. Changes to CSS, templates, or content instantly reflect in the browser.

## Deployment

Static sites can be deployed anywhere:
- **Netlify** (my choice)
- **Vercel** 
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Traditional hosting**

The build process creates pure HTML/CSS/JS that works on any web server.

## Conclusion

Eleventy strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power. It gets out of your way and lets you focus on content and design rather than fighting with complex build processes.

For portfolios and content-focused sites, I highly recommend giving Eleventy a try!
